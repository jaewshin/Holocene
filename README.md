This github repository contains all the codes that were used for analysis in:

Jaeweon Shin, Michael Holton Price, David H Wolpert, Hajime Shimao, Brendan Tracey, Timothy A Kohler. (2019). Scale and Information-Processing Thresholds in Holocene Social Evolution

## Usage

To replicate the results in the paper, download requirements.txt, data1.csv, data2.csv, seshat.py, and make_seshat_information_article_results.py and run the following command from terminal. Note that the code is written in Python 3.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 make_seshat_information_article_results.py
```

This will install all the needed packages to run the code and generate all the figures contained in the paper in the order that is listed in the paper, including the supplementary figures. When running the above command, make sure that data1.csv, data2.csv, and seshat.py files are in the same directory as make_seshat_information_article_results.py file.
